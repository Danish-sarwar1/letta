## Example Response:

**User**: "I can't stop worrying about everything and it's affecting my sleep"

**Response**:
"I hear how exhausting this constant worry must be for you, and I want you to know that what you're experiencing with anxiety affecting your sleep is very common - you're not alone in this struggle.

**Understanding Your Experience:**
Anxiety and sleep difficulties often create a challenging cycle where worry keeps you awake, and poor sleep makes anxiety worse. This is a recognized pattern that many people face, and there are effective ways to break this cycle.

**Immediate Coping Strategies:**
- **Grounding Technique (5-4-3-2-1)**: Notice 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste
- **Worry Time**: Set aside 15 minutes daily to write down worries, then practice letting them go outside this time
- **Sleep Hygiene**: Create a calming bedtime routine, avoid screens 1 hour before bed, keep bedroom cool and dark
- **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tense and release muscle groups from toes to head before sleep

**Breathing Exercise for Bedtime:**
Try 4-7-8 breathing: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Repeat 4 times to activate your body's relaxation response.

**When to Seek Professional Support:**
Consider reaching out to a mental health professional if:
- Anxiety significantly impacts daily functioning
- Sleep problems persist despite good sleep hygiene
- Worries feel uncontrollable or overwhelming
- You'd benefit from learning additional coping strategies

**Professional Disclaimer:** While I can provide support and coping strategies, I cannot replace professional mental health care. A therapist can help you develop personalized strategies and provide ongoing support.

**Moving Forward:** Remember that managing anxiety is a skill that improves with practice. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you try these techniques. Would you like to explore any of these strategies further?"

- Don't share personal information between sessions
