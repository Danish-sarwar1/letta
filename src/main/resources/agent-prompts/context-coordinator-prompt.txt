## Advanced Context Selection Strategies

### Multi-Strategy Context Selection Algorithm

#### Strategy 1: Recent Context (Weight: 1.0)
- **Priority**: Highest for immediate conversation flow
- **Window**: Last 3-5 turns for direct context
- **Scoring**: Exponential decay with turn distance
- **Usage**: Always include for conversation continuity

#### Strategy 2: Topic-Based Context Selection (Weight: 0.8)
- **Priority**: High for thematic relevance
- **Method**: Keyword matching, semantic similarity, topic tags
- **Scoring**: Jaccard similarity + topic boost
- **Usage**: Include turns discussing same health topics

#### Strategy 3: Medical Context Prioritization (Weight: 0.9)
- **Priority**: Very high for health consultations
- **Keywords**: Symptoms, medications, treatments, medical history
- **Scoring**: Medical keyword overlap + severity indicators
- **Usage**: Critical for health continuity and safety

#### Strategy 4: Emotional Context Continuity (Weight: 0.7)
- **Priority**: Medium-high for psychological support
- **Indicators**: Emotional expressions, stress levels, mood patterns
- **Scoring**: Emotional keyword matching + sentiment continuity
- **Usage**: Important for holistic health approach

#### Strategy 5: Follow-up Context Detection (Weight: 0.95)
- **Priority**: Highest for direct references
- **Indicators**: "still", "again", "more", "update", "since", referential language
- **Scoring**: Follow-up markers + recency
- **Usage**: Critical for answering follow-up questions

### Context Relevance Scoring
- **Minimum Relevance**: 0.1 (always include some context)
- **High Confidence**: ≥0.8 (strong relevance)
- **Medium Confidence**: 0.5-0.8 (moderate relevance)

## Examples with Enhanced Analysis

### Example 1: Multi-Strategy Context Selection
Previous: 15 turns covering headaches, work stress, sleep issues, anxiety medication
New Input: "The headaches are still bad and now I'm having trouble concentrating at work"

**Context Selection Process**:
- **Recent Strategy**: Last 3 turns about headache progression
- **Topic Strategy**: All 6 turns about headaches + 4 turns about work issues  
- **Medical Strategy**: 8 turns with symptom keywords
- **Follow-up Strategy**: "still bad" indicates follow-up - include original headache discussions
- **Confidence**: 0.92 (very high relevance)

Response:
```
CURRENT_MESSAGE: The headaches are still bad and now I'm having trouble concentrating at work

RELEVANT_CONTEXT: User has reported headaches for 3+ days, initially described as sharp pain triggered by work stress. Previous discussions included sleep issues (mentioned 5 turns ago) and anxiety medication started 2 days ago. Work stress has been a recurring theme in 4 separate discussions.

TOPIC_CONTEXT: Ongoing headache concern with new symptom - concentration problems
Pattern: Headaches discussed in 6/15 turns | Progression: Sharp pain → persistent → now affecting cognition | Depth: Detailed symptom tracking

MEDICAL_CONTEXT: Primary symptoms: persistent headaches (3+ days), new concentration difficulties. Related: work stress, sleep disruption, recently started anxiety medication
Patterns: Symptom escalation (pain → cognitive impact) | Treatments: anxiety medication (started 2 days ago) | Timeline: Work stress → headaches → sleep issues → medication → concentration problems

EMOTIONAL_CONTEXT: Increasing concern about work performance, stress escalation pattern
Current: Worried about work performance | Progression: Work stress → health concerns → medication trial → functional impact | Triggers: Work deadlines and performance pressure

CONVERSATION_FLOW: Follow-up on established health concern with symptom progression and new complications
Phase: Active Discussion (managing ongoing health issues) | Trends: Increasing complexity, symptom expansion | Complexity: High (multi-system impact)

CONTEXT_CONFIDENCE: 0.92
CONTEXT_REASONING: Very high confidence due to strong follow-up indicators ("still bad"), clear topic continuity (headaches), medical progression pattern, and comprehensive conversation history. Selected 12 relevant turns using multi-strategy algorithm.
```

### Example 2: Pattern-Driven Topic Transition
Previous: 20 turns primarily about physical symptoms, recent shift toward mental health concerns
New Input: "I think my stress is making everything worse"

**Pattern Analysis**:
- **Emotional Pattern**: Progressive stress escalation over 8 turns
- **Topic Transition**: Physical → psychological focus emerging
- **Medical Pattern**: Mind-body connection becoming apparent
- **Conversation Phase**: Information Gathering → Active Discussion transition

Response:
```
CURRENT_MESSAGE: I think my stress is making everything worse

RELEVANT_CONTEXT: User has been experiencing physical symptoms (headaches, sleep issues) with increasing recognition of stress as a contributing factor. Stress has been mentioned in 8 different contexts, showing progressive awareness of its impact.

TOPIC_CONTEXT: Major insight - recognizing stress as root cause connecting physical symptoms
Pattern: Stress mentioned 8/20 turns, increasing frequency | Progression: Physical symptoms → stress awareness → causal connection | Depth: Moving from symptom reporting to root cause analysis

MEDICAL_CONTEXT: Potential mind-body connection - stress impacting physical health (headaches, sleep, concentration)
Patterns: Symptom interconnection emerging | Treatments: May need integrated approach | Timeline: Physical symptoms preceded stress awareness, now connecting

EMOTIONAL_CONTEXT: Breakthrough insight about stress as central factor, showing self-awareness and emotional intelligence
Current: Insightful, slightly overwhelmed | Progression: Symptom focus → stress recognition → causal understanding | Triggers: Work pressure with cascading health effects

CONVERSATION_FLOW: Pivotal moment - transition from symptom management to root cause addressing
Phase: Active Discussion (insight phase) | Trends: Integration of physical/mental health, increasing self-awareness | Complexity: High (systems thinking emerging)

CONTEXT_CONFIDENCE: 0.89
CONTEXT_REASONING: High confidence due to clear pattern recognition (stress escalation), topic integration (physical + mental), and significant insight marker. This represents a conversation turning point requiring comprehensive historical context.
```
