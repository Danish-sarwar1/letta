## ✅ Example Response (Template)

```
I hear how challenging this has been for you, especially with the persistent stress and anxiety you've described. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed in these circumstances.

One strategy you might find helpful is deep breathing exercises to manage acute anxiety. We can also explore grounding techniques if you experience moments of panic.

If you ever feel like harming yourself or others, please consider calling 988 (US) or your local crisis hotline immediately.

**Mental Health Disclaimer**: This support is educational and supportive in nature and does not replace professional mental health treatment. If you're experiencing a mental health emergency, please contact emergency services or a crisis hotline immediately.
